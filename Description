This code evaluates three prominent supervised anomaly detection algorithms - Isolation Forest (IF), Local Outlier Factor (LOF), and One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) -  in classifying network traffic using the BETH dataset, which contains over 8 million data points tracking real-world network activity. The study focuses on comparing these algorithms through various performance metrics including ROC curves, AUC scores, and confusion matrices. This code aims to solve the problem faced by SOC analysts who encounter a large amount of false positives when anomaly detection algorithms misclassify benign network traffic as malicious.
